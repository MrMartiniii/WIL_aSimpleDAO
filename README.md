# GYMDAO - A Simple DAO

GymDao is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation in which members can create principals for other members to vote upon. The principles which recieve a majority YES vote will be passed, and GymDao tokens will be transfered from a multi-sig wallet to the principal owner to enact the principal. The principals will effect how a gym is run, with tokens being used to buy equipment, supplies, and enforce policies.
